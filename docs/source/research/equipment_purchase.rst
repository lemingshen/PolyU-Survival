Associate Money
================================================

1. Reimbursement Rules
---------------------------------------------
* Each new PhD student is entitled to **20,000 HKD** of associate money for reimbursement. This fund is typically used for purchasing equipment or supporting conference expenses.
* We recommend selecting equipment that costs **less than 15,000 HKD**, as purchases exceeding this amount will be handled directly by the department, which may cause significant delays.
* The reimbursement process follows four stages:
  
  1. Select your preferred devices online and prepare a quotation form.  
  2. Submit the quotation form to the department for approval.  
  3. Once approved, purchase the devices and retain the bank slip.  
  4. Submit the payment details and supporting materials to the department, then wait for FO to reimburse the amount directly to your bank card.  

2. Preparing the Quotation Form
---------------------------------------------
* The quotation form should ideally come from an HK-based company, for example: `Future Technology <https://buymore.hk/shop/?srsltid=AfmBOopqyBdOM7VtSmVPGS89blRueCIgtLNogkKSVgfpafbCah1vyI_V>`_.  
* Save the generated quotation as a **PDF file**.  
* Create an **Excel file** listing all requested items.  

3. Submitting Materials to the Department
---------------------------------------------
* Complete the **purchase requisition form** provided in the department email.  
* Submit the requisition form, quotation PDF, and Excel file to the department contact (e.g., Jason) via email.  

4. Purchasing Equipment
---------------------------------------------
* Once approval is granted, you may proceed with the purchase online.  
* Always remember to save your **payment record**.  

5. Submitting Your Purchase Record
---------------------------------------------
* Send the final purchase record and supporting documents to the department for reimbursement.  
* Wait for FO to process and reimburse the amount.
