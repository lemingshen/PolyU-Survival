Reimbursement
============================================================


1. Supplementary Material Preparation
---------------------------------------------
Before you start, please make sure you have the following materials ready in **PDF format**:

* The conference information (*e.g.*, the homepage of `MobiCom 2025 <https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2025/>`_).
* The acceptance email if you have a paper, poster, demo, or workshop paper. For example:
   .. figure:: ../../assets/reimbursement/notification_email.png
      :width: 100%
      :align: center
      :alt: Notification email example

      Notification email example
* Itinerary of your planned trip, including departure and return dates. :download:`Example <../../assets/reimbursement/itinerary.pdf>`.
* Registration fee information (*e.g.*, `MobiCom 2025 Registration <https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2025/registration.html>`_).
* Other relevant documents
   * VISA application fee, plane tickets, and accommodation information (estimated). :download:`Example <../../assets/reimbursement/Plane Accommodation VISA.pdf>`.
   * MRS Form (if applicable). **Make sure that the highlighted part is filled** :download:`Example <../../assets/reimbursement/MRS Form (Non-purchase).docx>`.

.. note::
   Make sure that all Supplementary documents are in **PDF format**. For estimated plane tickets and accommodation information, I suggest pick an expensive one to avoid under-budgeting, as the reimbursement will be based on the actual expense you incur during the trip but will not exceed what you claimed.
