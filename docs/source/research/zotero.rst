* The left panel displays the outline of the paper. In addition, it can also display the annotations you made on the paper.
* The center panel shows the content of the paper. On top of the center panel, there are several useful tools for reading and annotating the paper.
    * The first tool is to highlight the selected text with different colors.
    * The second tool is to underline the selected text with different colors.
    * The third tool is to add sticky notes to any part of the paper.
    * The fourth tool is to add text boxes to any part of the paper.
    * The fifth tool is to add rectangles to any part of the paper.
    * The sixth tool is to add drawings to any part of the paper. It would be better if you use a tablet with a stylus pen to draw.
* The right panel provides detailed information about the paper as well as some third-party plugins you installed.
