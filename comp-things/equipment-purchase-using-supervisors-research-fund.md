# Equipment Purchase using Supervisor's Research Fund

During the PhD research period, you may need to purchase some equipment or services for your research, such as embedded devices and OpenAI API services. This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to apply for equipment purchase using your supervisor's research funding.

1. First, ask you supervisor for approval before you purchase any equipment or services.
2. Fill the Miscellaneous Expenses Claim Form. You download the form: [here](../.gitbook/assets/comp/Miscellaneous_Expenses_Claim Form.pdf)
   {% file src="../.gitbook/assets/comp/Miscellaneous_Expenses_Claim Form.pdf" %}

3. Fill additional forms if needed. For example, if you are using the supervisor's MRS, fill the MRS form:
   {% file src="../.gitbook/assets/comp/MRS Form (Non-purchase).docx" %}

4. Prepare the supplementary materials, **i.e.**, the invoices or receipts of the equipment or services you purchased.
5. Send all these materials to [IU, Jason](mailto:jason.iu@polyu.edu.hk) and cc your supervisor for approval.
