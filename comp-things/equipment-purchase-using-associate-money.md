# Equipment Purchase using Associate Money

1. Purchasing Rules

* Each new PhD student is entitled to **20,000 HKD** of associate money for reimbursement. This fund is typically used for purchasing equipment or supporting conference expenses.
* We recommend selecting equipment that costs **less than 15,000 HKD**, as purchases exceeding this amount will be handled directly by the department, which may cause significant delays.
* The reimbursement process follows four stages:
  * Select your preferred devices online and prepare a quotation form.  
  * Submit the quotation form to the department for approval.  
  * Once approved, purchase the devices and retain the bank slip.  
  * Submit the payment details and supporting materials to the department, then wait for FO to reimburse the amount directly to your bank card.  

2. Preparing the Quotation Form

* The quotation form should ideally come from an HK-based company, for example: [Future Technology](https://buymore.hk/shop/?srsltid=AfmBOopqyBdOM7VtSmVPGS89blRueCIgtLNogkKSVgfpafbCah1vyI_V). 
* Save the generated quotation as a **PDF file**.  
* Create an **Excel file** listing all requested items.  

3. Submitting Materials to the Department

* Complete the **purchase requisition form** provided in the department email.  
* Submit the requisition form, quotation PDF, and Excel file to the department contact (**e.g.**, Jason) via email.  

4. Purchasing Equipment

* Once approval is granted, you may proceed with the purchase online.  
* Always remember to save your **payment record**.  

5. Submitting Your Purchase Record

* Send the final purchase record and supporting documents to the department for reimbursement.  
* Wait for FO to process and reimburse the amount.
