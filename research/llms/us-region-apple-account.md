* Now sign in your US Apple account in the App store of your **least frequently used device**. The system will send another OTP to your phone number for verification. Wait for a couple of minutes and enter the code you received.

{% hint style="danger" %}
### IMPORTANT

To keep your account valid, you **MUST** keep the US account being signed in on you iOS device. Otherwise, if you sign out and try to sign in the US account again, the system will require OTP again. However, the US phone number is only valid for 60 minutes. Therefore, you **MUST** keep your account be signed in (App Store only). You may use your least frequently used device (**e.g.**, iPad).
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

### Step 4: Add a Payment Method or Add Money to Your Account
