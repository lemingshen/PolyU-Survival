# Apply for a Switzerland Card

To enable unobstructed and fluent global payment, HK credit cards are not sufficient. Therefore, if you are interested, I strongly recommend you to open up an Switzerland Card online. [SafePal](https://safepal.com/zh-cn/bank) began as a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet (software + hardware + wallet-app) that lets users securely store, send, and receive many kinds of cryptocurrencies and NFTs across multiple blockchains. Through a collaboration with a regulated bank (Fiat24), users can open a compliant bank account (with real account details / IBAN) directly from the SafePal App.

The Fiat24 bank is 100% safe and real. The address of the bank is:

### IMPORTANT
  
If you need cryptocurrency (*e.g.*, ETH, BTC, USDT), you can contact me. No need to create a new cryptocurrency account, it's too complex and time-consuming.

* Congratulations! After around one business day, the money will be transferred to your SafePal account.

A handling fee of HK$70 will be charged for each transaction, regardless of the amount transferred. Therefore, you may enter a large amount to avoid frequent transfer.
